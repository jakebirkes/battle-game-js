## Getting Started

Each player roles on 1d6 die to see who goes first. Highest number goes first and the order goes clockwise.

In order, each player chooses a Species card and its matching token (color).

In reverse order, the last player to select their species card now selects a Role card first and goes back to the first player. There are however role cards that are incompatible with certain species cards. See back of species card, or back of role card.

If you change your mind, you're welcome to trade species card and/or role card. 

## Attacking in Battle

There are two kinds of attack: Magical (**SPL**) & Physical (**HIT**)

### Step One: Meet the Conditions & Decide

In order to attack, the it must be during the player's turn and they must occupy the same spot their opponent is located. The attacking player **MUST** decide first which kind of attack to use.

### Step Two: Let the Defending Player Know

Once the player has spoken which attack they have chosen and who they are attacking, the defending player will have a chance to dodge:

- If the attacking player uses **SPL**, the defending player must try to outwit them (**WIT**).

  ***SPL vs. WIT***

- If the attacking player uses **HIT**, the defending player must try to use their dexterity to get away (**DEX**).

  ***HIT vs. DEX***

### Step Three: Both Players Roll

Both attacking player and the defending player will each roll one six-sided dice. Both players add their results to the correct stat. 

If the attacking player is using **HIT**:

- The attacking player will add their rolled result to their **HIT**
- The defending player will add their rolled result to their **DEX**

If the attacking player is using **SPL**:

- The attacking player will add their rolled result to their **SPL**
- The defending player will add their rolled result to their **WIT**

### Step Four: Compare the Totals

If the attacking player's result is **greater than or equal to** the defending player's total, the defending player failed to dodge the attacking player. **Subtract the difference between the two results and proceed to Step Five.**

If the attacking player's result is **less than** the defending player's total, the defending player successfully to dodged the attacking player. **Ends Here**

### Step Five: Attacking Player Rolls Again

If the defending player is unsuccessful in dodging the attack, the defending player must refer to their defense (**DEF**).

The attacking player rolls one six-side dice. Add the result difference from Step Four to this rolled result:

- If the total is **greater than** the defending player's **DEF**, ???
- If the total is **less than or equal to** the defending player's **DEF**, nothing happens. **Ends Here** 

### Example:

Player One is a Dog/Warrior and attempts to attack player Two, Monkey/Guardian. Player One decides it's best to attack using **HIT** so player one must refer to their own **DEX**. 

Each player rolls a six sided die.

Player One rolled a **4** and their HIT is **"+5"**  = **9**

Player Two rolled a **3** and their DEX is **"+3"** = **7**

Player One's total **9** is greater than Player One's total **7**. 

**9 > 7** 

*A hit was made!*

9 - 7 = **2 remaining**

Player One rolls one more time and gets a **3** plus the **2 remaining** = **5**

Player Two now refers to their DEF = **2** 

Player One second result was **5** (3 + 2), which is greater than **2** 

5 > 2

= *Success!*
